# Apache-camel Complete Guide

## Chapter 1  Apache camel Basic Terminology

#### Message: Messages are used for communication between systems via messaging channels.
#### They flow one-way — from sender to receiver.
A message contains:
- Body (payload)
- Headers
- Optional attachments

Each message has a unique identifier (String type), ensured by the message creator.
Format is protocol-dependent.
If no ID is provided by the protocol, Camel auto-generates one using its UID generator.

## Chapter 5 Messaging Systems
A message is the smallest unit for transmitting data in a messaging system (represented by the grey dot in the figure below). The message itself might have some internal structure — for example, a message containing multiple parts — which is represented by geometrical figures attached to the grey dot

### Types of message
Apache Camel defines the following distinct message types:
- In message  —  A message that travels through a route from a consumer endpoint to a producer endpoint (typically, initiating a message exchange).
- Out message  —  A message that travels through a route from a producer endpoint back to a consumer endpoint (usually, in response to an In message).

All of these message types are represented internally by the org.apache.camel.Message interface.
### Message structure
By default, Apache Camel applies the following structure to all message types:
- Headers  —  Contains metadata or header data extracted from the message.
- Body  —  Usually contains the entire message in its original form.
- Attachments  —  Message attachments (required for integrating with certain messaging systems, such as JBI).
It’s good to know that dividing a message into headers, body, and attachments is just a way to understand it. Apache Camel works with many components that create different types of messages. In the end, each component decides how the message is organized and what information goes into the headers or body.

### Correlating messages
Internally, Apache Camel remembers the message IDs, which are used to correlate individual messages. In practice, however, the most important way that Apache Camel correlates messages is through exchange objects.

### Exchange objects
An exchange object is an entity that encapsulates related messages, where the collection of related messages is referred to as a message exchange and the rules governing the sequence of messages are referred to as an exchange pattern. For example, two common exchange patterns are: one-way event messages (consisting of an In message), and request-reply exchanges (consisting of an In message, followed by an Out message).

## Accessing messages
When defining a routing rule in the XML DSL, you can access the headers and body of a message using the following elements:

- `<setHeader headerName="name">…</setHeader>` — Sets the named header in the current message.
- `<setBody>…</setBody>` — Sets or changes the body of the current message.
- `<transform>` — Can be used to change the body of the message.

For example, to populate the `username` header in the current message, you can use the following XML DSL route:

```xml
<route id="example-route">
    <from uri="SourceURL"/>
    <setHeader headerName="username">
        <constant>John.Doe</constant>
    </setHeader>
    <to uri="TargetURL"/>
</route>
```

## 5.2. Message Channel

### ✅ Overview
A **message channel** is like a path or a pipe where messages travel in a messaging system. By sending messages through different channels, you can separate and organize different types of messages.

- Examples of message channels are:
  - **Queues** – where messages wait to be processed one by one.
  - **Topics** – where messages are broadcast to multiple subscribers.

**Important:**  
A *logical* message channel (like a queue or topic) is not the same as a *physical* channel (like a wire or server connection). One logical channel can be implemented in different ways in the system.

In **Apache Camel**, message channels are represented by endpoint URIs that are part of message-oriented components. These endpoints define where and how messages are sent or received.

### ✅ Message Channel Pattern
A message channel organizes messages by type or purpose. Different message-oriented components in Apache Camel use this pattern to allow applications to connect and exchange messages easily.

---

### ✅ Message-Oriented Components in Apache Camel

The following components in Camel use message channels:

### 1️⃣ ActiveMQ
- Uses **queues** and **topics** as message channels.
- Example formats:
  - Queue: `activemq:QueueName`
  - Topic: `activemq:topic:TopicName`
  
- **Example:**  
  To send messages to the queue named `Foo.Bar`, the endpoint URI would be:  
  `activemq:Foo.Bar`

For more details, check the **ActiveMQ** section in the Apache Camel Component Reference Guide.

---

### 2️⃣ JMS (Java Messaging Service)

- JMS is a general interface to connect to many message systems like ActiveMQ, MQSeries, Tibco, and more.
- It supports both **queues** and **topics**.
- Example formats:
  - Queue: `jms:QueueName`
  - Topic: `jms:topic:TopicName`

For more details, check the **JMS** section in the Apache Camel Component Reference Guide.

---

### 3️⃣ AMQP (Advanced Message Queuing Protocol)

- AMQP also supports queues and topics.
- Example formats:
  - Queue: `amqp:QueueName`
  - Topic: `amqp:topic:TopicName`

For more details, check the **AMQP** section in the Apache Camel Component Reference Guide.

---

### ✅ Key Takeaways
- A message channel is a way to send and organize messages in a system.
- Apache Camel uses endpoint URIs to define where messages go.
- Different components (ActiveMQ, JMS, AMQP) provide ways to connect and work with queues and topics.
- You can easily switch between different messaging systems because these components follow standard patterns.

  ## 5.3. Message Endpoint

### ✅ Overview
A **message endpoint** is the connection between an application and a messaging system. It’s where messages are sent from or received by the application.

As shown in the Message Endpoint Pattern, you can have:
- A **sender endpoint** (sometimes called a proxy or service consumer), which is responsible for sending messages.
- A **receiver endpoint** (sometimes called a service or endpoint), which is responsible for receiving messages.

These endpoints allow your application to exchange messages using different channels such as queues, topics, files, etc.

---

### ✅ Types of Endpoint

Apache Camel defines two basic types of endpoints:

1️⃣ **Consumer endpoint**  
- Appears at the start of a route.  
- Reads incoming messages from a channel (like a queue or file folder).  
- Equivalent to a receiver endpoint.

2️⃣ **Producer endpoint**  
- Appears at the end of a route.  
- Sends outgoing messages to a channel (like a queue or topic).  
- Equivalent to a sender endpoint.  
- A route can have multiple producer endpoints.

---

### ✅ Endpoint URIs

In Apache Camel, an endpoint is identified by an **endpoint URI**, which contains important details such as location and configuration.

- **Consumer endpoint URI:**  
  Specifies where messages are coming from or which service is exposed for incoming messages. For example, a queue or file location.

- **Producer endpoint URI:**  
  Specifies where to send the messages, including configurations or the destination name.
